# Introduction

In this case study we will build on the alive-dead model constructed earlier to construct a progressive disease model in Amua. A state transition "bubble" diagram of this model is shown below:

![State Transition Diagram for Progressive Disease Model](images/clipboard-3451439054.png){fig-align="center" width="1800"}

In this model, individuals start off healthy and can develop a hypothetical disease. The disease begins asymptomatic (i.e., the patient has the disease but experiences very little effects) but can progress to a more severe state that increases the likelihood of death. All individuals in the model will experience mortality from other causes---but those with progressive disease can also die from the disease.

Suppose there are two new treatment options available:

1.  A one-time vaccine that reduces the likelihood of developing the disease.
2.  A drug that reduces the likelihood of death from progressive disease.

We will compare each of these strategies to a "status quo" strategy of doing nothing.

# Model Parameters

Relevant model parameters are summarized in the tables below:
