## Welcome Letter

Congrats on being selected to join us for the Health Economics Decision Modeling Workshop in Cebu. To provide you the best experience possible, we are asking you to complete some pre-work.

This work will help you prepare for the capstone that you will be completing in the workshop. This may feel backwards, since typically you would receive the education then do an example. Since we are asking you to do work without a modeling background, we have attempted to create tools to help you collect the information you need without the modeling experience. However, you will likely run into problems. Please reach out if you have any questions that we can help with.

### Please complete the following before the workshop:

1.  Pre-Workshop: Topic Survey that will sent to your email in Mid-November

2.  Collecting data using the [data collection tool](https://geratcliff.shinyapps.io/shinyapp_data/)

3.  Pre-Workshop: Data Collection Survey that will sent to your email in early January

4.  Download AMUA

5.  Slides to introduce yourself and your topic (format below)

6.  Pre-Workshop: knowledge baseline that will sent to your email right before the workshop

## Data Collection Tool

As we mentioned before, we understand the difficulty of trying to collect data for your project without knowing the modeling methods. We have attempted to create tools to help you collect the information you need without the modeling experience. However, you will likely run into problems. There is a form submission at the bottom of the tool to ask for assistance from the team. Read the following below before starting the work within the tool.

### About the tool

This tool will walk you through tabs from left to right (Introduction → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6), to help you determine the data points that you need. The model has been created without modeling specific text to help you understand the steps on each tab.

#### You will

-   Describe your disease/health condition

-   Choose strategies to compare

-   Identify health states

-   List events that happen

-   Collect data that can be downloaded as an Excel file

### Saving your work

The tool will auto save your changes to your machine, but we HIGHLY recommend using the backup save after each session to ensure you do not lose all your data. When you click the `Download Backup` button, a file will download to your computer (it ends in .rds)

::: callout-note
The Excel download on tab 6 cannot be loaded back into the tool.
:::

### Working together

We recommend that all participants complete tabs 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. However, you can work on step 6 together once you agree on the other states. The `.rds` file that is saved upon clicking the `Download Backup` button can be shared with the rest of your assigned topic team so you can work together on data collection

::: callout-caution
The `.rds` file will include all the data you input. If you are using sensitive or classified data. You can must make a note in the tool instead of uploading it and keep the data saved somewhere easy to access on your machine.
:::

**In early January, we will be asking for the `.rds` to understand the progress that has been made on data collection.**

### For assistance with the tool

Start with the walk-through under the `❓Help & FAQ` section. If that is unable to answer your questions, please reach out to get assistance.
